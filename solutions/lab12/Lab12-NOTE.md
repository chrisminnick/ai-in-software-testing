# Lab 12 - Limitations and Ethics

**Note**: The first version of `aiGenerated.test.js` contains intentionally incorrect expectations.

- It expects `isEven(-4)` to be false, but the correct answer is true.
- It expects `isEven('four')` to return false, but the function is designed to throw an error.

These incorrect tests illustrate the risk of over-trusting AI-generated output.

Use the corrected version later in the lab for proper, passing tests.
