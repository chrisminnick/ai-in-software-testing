# AI in Software Testing — Prompt-as-Code Workbook

This repository is a student template for the **AI in Software Testing** course.

The idea: Treat your prompts like code.

- Write them down.
- Version them (commit refinements).
- Document what worked and what didn’t.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo into your editor/IDE.
2. Open `workbook.md` and fill in the sections during each lab.
3. Use Git to commit your changes after each refinement:
   ```bash
   git add workbook.md
   git commit -m "Updated Lab 2 prompt refinements"
   ```
4. Optionally, push to your own GitHub repo for safekeeping.
